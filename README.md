# Introduction to React Router

## Objectives

1. Describe __React Router's__ approach to client-side routing
2. Explain how React Router allows building a route tree as a component
3. Describe how routes are matched in React Router

## A complicated world needs an address

So far, we have been building our applications without any navigation, so
everything in the app has lived at the same url. Currently, we can make it look
like we are changing the page, by showing or hiding some components, but none of
these changes are dependent on a change in the url.

Now this may seem like a small quibble, but web addresses are the backbone of
the Internet. The web is just a series of links to other pages, after all. Let's
imagine that we have a React application hosted at www.loveforsoils.com
dedicated to sharing knowledge about [soil types][soils]. As a facet of our
React application, we want to provide users with the option to see a list of our
favorite soils. Currently, instead of sharing a link to a list of our favorite
soils, we can only provide a link to our "Love for soils" homepage. Following
which, users are required to interact with our application to see a favorite
soil list.

Because our personal opinion on the best soils is so important, we want to
provide users with the opportunity to go straight to this list of the favorite
soils view with a url. Enter __React Router__: a routing library for __React__
that allows us to link to specific urls then show or hide various components
depending on which url is displayed. As React Router's documentation states:

> Components are the heart of React's powerful, declarative programming model.
React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose
declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have bookmarkable URLs
for your web app or a composable way to navigate in React Native, React Router
works wherever React is rendering--so take your pick!

For this README we will be building our first Component routes as a Code Along.

## Code Along

#### Step 1: Setting up our Main Route

*Note*: Make sure you clone down this repo, run `npm install && npm start`, and open
http://localhost:3000 in the browser.

If you open up the src/index.js file you will see that currently we are defining
a Home component, and then rendering that component in the DOM.  

```javascript
// ./src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <Home />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

With React Router our core routing will live in this component. We will define
our various routes within this file. Let's install that package now.

```
npm install react-router-dom
```

We now want to import the __BrowserRouter__ component as a __Router__ and the
__Route__ component and inject it into our __Home__ component.

```javascript
// .src/index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
// Step 1. Import react-router functions
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

// Step 2. Changed to have router coordinate what is displayed
ReactDOM.render((
  <Router>
    <Route path="/" render={Home} />
  </Router>),
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Step 1: In Step 1 above, there are two components that we are importing from __React
Router__. We use them in turn.   

Step 2: The __Router__ (our alias for BrowserRouter) component is the base for
our application's routing. It is where we declare how __React Router__ will be
used. Notice that nested inside the __Router__ component we use the __Route__
component. The __Route__ component has two props in our example: ```path```
and ```render```. The __Route__ component is in charge of saying: "when the url
matches this specified ```path```, render this specified ```component```".

Let's try it. Run npm start to boot up the application and then point your url
to localhost:3000. What you'll notice is that when you type in the url it will
render a `<div><h1>Home!</h1></div>`.

#### Adding Additional Routes

In the last two steps we learned how to set up the basic __Router__ component
and inject our very first __Route__ component.

Next, we want to add components for __About__ and __Login__:

```javascript
// ./src/index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

const About = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>This is my about component!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

const Login = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <form>
        <div>
          <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" />
          <label htmlFor="username">Username</label>
        </div>
        <div>
          <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" />
          <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
        </div>
        <input type="submit" value="Login" />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Following, let's add our `/about` and `/login` routes to our router:

```javascript
// ./src/index.js

ReactDOM.render((
  <Router>
      <Route path="/" render={Home} />
      <Route exact path="/about" render={About} />
      <Route exact path="/login" render={Login} />
  </Router>),
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Reload your browser and look at our beautiful routes...oops! Error:  

<span style='color:red'>A &lt;Router&gt; may have only one child element</span>   

If you open up your browser dev tools console you should be seeing the same
error. What does this mean? Well, as you know in React, a component must return
one child/html node (which may wrap many others). We just gave __Router__ three
children! To remedy this problem we can place all of the __Route__ components
into a `<div>` tag or a _fragment_:

```javascript
ReactDOM.render((
  <Router>
    <React.Fragment>
      <Route path="/" render={Home} />
      <Route exact path="/about" render={About} />
      <Route exact path="/login" render={Login} />
    </React.Fragment>
  </Router>),
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Let's go back to the browser and assert that our application is back to
functioning. We see that our __Home__ component is displaying. Try manually
typing in the url locations for `/`, `/about`, and `/login`. Do you see the
other components rendering?

You may have noticed the aberrant behavior of the __Home__ component. It is
always rendering, no matter which route we go to! Even if we type in nonsense
following the `/`, we still get the __Home__ component.

Imagine we had a header we wanted displayed no matter which route was hit. In
that case, this behavior is desirable! Otherwise, there are several ways to fix
this. One way is to change our __Route__ component for __Home__ to `exact path`
instead of just `path`. Try it now.


#### Recap

* We imported the `react-router-dom` node module into our `index.js` with the
__BrowserRouter as Router__ and the __Route__ components

* We returned __Router__ as the top level component in our React application

* We defined three possible routes, each of which is doing the following:
  * defining what urls to match on
  * defining what component should be rendered, should a match return true
  * setting an attribute of exact, which explicitly states that you will only see
the rendered component if you go to `/about` not `/about/something_else` or
`/abo`.

We have made great progress so far. Because we are programmers who think ahead,
and want to write code that can scale, let's refactor!

### Components as Props

If we look closely, we see our 'components' being passed to the `render` props
are merely functions defined above that return JSX.

So far, we have been using the __Route__ component's `render` prop to describe
what should be rendered when a match occurs. As an alternative to defining the
arrow functions for **Home**, **About**, and **Login**, we could have simply
done it inline, i.e.:

```javascript
<Route path="/" render={() => <h1>Home!</h1>} />
```

While this inline style may be useful for very simple renders, it becomes
unreasonable when we want to render larger, more complex, components. In
anticipation of a growing codebase, let's refactor by removing the components we
defined in `index.js` and placing them in their own files in `src/`.
Additionally, let's change them to classic class `React.Component`s, i.e.:

```javascript
class Home extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Home!</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Now, let's refactor our __Router__ component in `index.js` to use your class
components:

```javascript
ReactDOM.render((
  <Router>
    <React.Fragment>
      <Route path="/" component={Home} />
      <Route exact path="/about" component={About} />
      <Route exact path="/login" component={Login} />
    </React.Fragment>
  </Router>),
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Take note: we changed the `render` prop to `component` within our __Route__
components. As it turns out, the __Route__ component API has a prop called
`component`.

What's the difference between using the `render` prop and the `component` prop
in our __Route__ component? In terms of user experience in our application,
there is none!

If you are interested in seeing the 'under the hood' differences between the
`render` and the `component` prop and when to use each take a moment to
familiarize yourself with the [__Route__ documentation][route_docs].

Now that we have the tools to enable routing, let's look into how we can enable
users to trigger our routes without requiring a manual change of the address
bar.

### NavLinks

What good are routes, if users don't know how to find them or what they are?

The React Router API provides two components that enable us to trigger our
routing: __&lt;Link&gt;__ and __&lt;NavLink&gt;__. They both have the same base
level functionality that will update the browser URL and render the __Route__
component. __&lt;NavLink&gt;__ acts as a superset of __&lt;Link&gt;__, adding
styling attributes to a rendered element when it matches the current URL.

Let's work on adding in the __&lt;NavLink&gt;__ component to our application.
For ease of display, we will work as if we still have all of our components in
one file. If you have broken them out into individual component files, update
accordingly:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
/* Add NavLink to importer */
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

/* Add basic styling for NavLinks */
const link = {
  width: '100px',
  padding: '12px',
  margin: '0 6px 6px',
  background: 'blue',
  textDecoration: 'none',
  color: 'white',
}

/* add the navbar component */
const Navbar = () =>
  <div>
    <NavLink
      to="/"
      /* set exact so it knows to only set activeStyle when route is deeply equal to link */
      exact
      /* add styling to Navlink */
      style={link}
      /* add prop for activeStyle */
      activeStyle={{
        background: 'darkblue'
      }}
    >Home</NavLink>
    <NavLink
      to="/about"
      exact
      style={link}
      activeStyle={{
        background: 'darkblue'
      }}
    >About</NavLink>
    <NavLink
      to="/login"
      exact
      style={link}
      activeStyle={{
        background: 'darkblue'
      }}
    >Login</NavLink>
  </div>;

const Home = () => <h1>Home!</h1>;

const About = () => <h1>This is my about component!</h1>;

const Login = () =>
  <form>
    <h1>Login</h1>
    <div>
      <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username" />
      <label htmlFor="username">Username</label>
    </div>
    <div>
      <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" />
      <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
    </div>
    <input type="submit" value="Login" />
  </form>;

ReactDOM.render((
  <Router>
    <React.Fragment>
      <Navbar />
      <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
      <Route exact path="/about" component={About} />
      <Route exact path="/login" component={Login} />
    </React.Fragment>
  </Router>),
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Load up the browser again and you should see beautiful blue navlinks that load
up the desired component. For more practice, implement `/signup` and `/messages`
routes/navlinks that load in components.
